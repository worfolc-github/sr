  A quick interlude on 'Q'
  as pointed out by one of the
  testers of this reform, in English
  Q is almost always followed by U
  or else it doesnt make the /kʷ/
  sound, so /kʷ/ will be represented
  as kw and KW

W w - Way example: Water /w/ words with the sequence 'wh' retain it

Definitions of Diphthongs, and Reasoning for lack of Inclusion of Schwa

ə (schwa) is extremely variable, and very hard to write while keeping the pronounciation (fairly) phonetically "correct" for
most dialects, so words with a schwa in them will retain the original spelling of the schwa rather than spelling 'the' as ðə


Diphthong Def.

eɪ - written as 'ay'
aʊ - written as 'au' (if r follows add e)
ɔɪ - written as 'oi' 
ɪə/ɪɹ - written as 'ìer' (RP and GA) 
eə/ɛɹ - written as 'eir' (RP and GA)
ʊə/ʊɹ - written as 'òur' except in 'or' which is written as 'òr' (RP and GA)  (word 'our' is written as 'Aure')
